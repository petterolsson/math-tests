### Answers and Solutions

#### Square Root Problems

1. **Find the square root of 144.**
   - The square root of 144 is 12, because \(12^2 = 144\).

2. **Calculate the square root of 0.64.**
   - The square root of 0.64 is 0.8, because \(0.8^2 = 0.64\).

3. **If the area of a square is 49 square meters, what is the length of one side?**
   - The length of one side is the square root of the area, so it's \(\sqrt{49} = 7\) meters.

4. **Determine the square root of 225.**
   - The square root of 225 is 15, because \(15^2 = 225\).

5. **A square garden has an area of 121 square meters. How long is each side?**
   - Each side is \(\sqrt{121} = 11\) meters.

#### Pythagorean Theorem Problems

6. **In a right-angled triangle, if one side is 8 meters and the other side is 6 meters, what is the length of the hypotenuse?**
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem: \(c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Here, \(c = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10\) meters.

7. **A ladder leans against a wall, reaching a height of 4 meters. If the bottom of the ladder is 3 meters from the base of the wall, what is the length of the ladder?**
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \(c = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5\) meters.

8. **The sides of a right triangle are 9 meters and 12 meters. Find the length of the hypotenuse.**
   - \(c = \sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{81 + 144} = \sqrt{225} = 15\) meters.

9. **A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 meters and one side of 5 meters. Calculate the length of the other side.**
   - Let the other side be \(b\). Using the Pythagorean theorem: \(b = \sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{169 - 25} = \sqrt{144} = 12\) meters.

10. **Find the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of 7 meters and 24 meters.**
    - \(c = \sqrt{7^2 + 24^2} = \sqrt{49 + 576} = \sqrt{625} = 25\) meters.

#### Word Problems Involving Square Roots

11. **A circular park has an area of 314 square meters. Calculate the radius of the park. (Use Ï€ = 3.14)**
    - Area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\). So, \(r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{314}{3.14}} = \sqrt{100} = 10\) meters.

12. **The diagonal of a square screen is 50 inches. What is the area of the screen in square inches?**
    - For a square, \(d = a\sqrt{2}\), where \(d\) is the diagonal and \(a\) is the side length. So, \(a = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{50}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{50}{1.414} \approx 35.36\) inches. Area \(= a^2 \approx 35.36^2 \approx 1250\) square inches.

13. **A rectangular garden is 16 meters long and has an area of 128 square meters. What is the width of the garden?**
    - Area \(= length \times width\), so \(width = \frac{Area}{length} = \frac{128}{16} = 8\) meters.

14. **A square tile has a diagonal length of 1.4 meters. What is the area of the tile?**
    - Side \(a = \frac{diagonal}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1.4}{\sqrt{2}}\). Area \(= a^2 = \left(\frac{1.4}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 0
