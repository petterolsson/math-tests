### Detailed Answers and Solutions

#### Square Root Problems

1. **Find the square root of 196.**
   - **Solution**: The square root of 196 is found by identifying a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 196. \(\sqrt{196} = 14\). This is because \(14 \times 14 = 196\).

2. **A square garden has an area of 169 square meters. Calculate the length of one side of the garden.**
   - **Solution**: The area of a square is calculated as the length of one side squared. To find the length of one side, take the square root of the area: \(\sqrt{169} = 13\) meters. Each side of the garden is 13 meters long.

#### Pythagorean Theorem Problems

3. **A ladder is placed against a wall such that it reaches a height of 5 meters. If the base of the ladder is 3 meters away from the wall, what is the length of the ladder?**
   - **Solution**: This is a classic application of the Pythagorean theorem, \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder, in this case), and \(a\) and \(b\) are the other two sides. Here, \(a = 3\) meters, and \(b = 5\) meters. So, \(c = \sqrt{3^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{9 + 25} = \sqrt{34}\) meters. The ladder is \(\sqrt{34}\) meters long, approximately 5.83 meters.

4. **In a right triangle, the lengths of the two shorter sides are 7 meters and 24 meters. Find the length of the hypotenuse.**
   - **Solution**: Apply the Pythagorean theorem: \(c = \sqrt{7^2 + 24^2} = \sqrt{49 + 576} = \sqrt{625} = 25\) meters. The hypotenuse is 25 meters long.

#### Similar Shapes Problems

5. **Two similar rectangular fields have lengths in the ratio 3:5. If the smaller field has a length of 9 meters, what is the length of the larger field?**
   - **Solution**: The length of the larger field can be found by setting up a proportion based on the given ratio. If the smaller field's length is 9 meters (which corresponds to the '3' part of the ratio), the larger field's length corresponding to '5' can be calculated as \(9 \times \frac{5}{3} = 15\) meters.

6. **A model car is made at a scale of 1:24 of the actual car. If the actual car is 4.8 meters long, how long is the model car?**
   - **Solution**: The length of the model car is \(4.8 \div 24 = 0.2\) meters or 20 centimeters. This demonstrates how scale factors are used to reduce dimensions in a proportional manner.

#### Word Problems

7. **A square painting is surrounded by a frame of uniform width. The total area of the painting and frame together is 625 square centimeters, while the area of the painting alone is 400 square centimeters. Determine the width of the frame.**
   - **Solution**: First, find the side length of the painting, which is \(\sqrt{400} = 20\) cm. Then, since the total area is 625 cm², the side length including the frame is \(\sqrt{625} = 25\) cm. The frame adds 5 cm to each side of the painting (25 cm - 20 cm), so its width is 2.5 cm all around (because the frame's width is added to both sides).

8. **A rectangular swimming pool is 10 meters long and 6 meters wide. A path of uniform width is to be built around the pool. If the total area of the pool and the path is 208 square meters, find the width of the path.**
   - **Solution**: The area of the pool is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square meters. The area of the pool plus the path is 208 square meters, so the path alone occupies \(208 - 60 = 148\) square meters. Let the width of the path be \(w\). The total length and width of the pool plus the path are \(10 + 2w\) and \(6 + 2w\), respectively. Thus, \((10 + 2w)(6 + 2w) = 208\). Simplifying, you can solve for \(w\) to find the

 width of the path.

9. **Two similar triangles have areas in the ratio 4:9. If the perimeter of the smaller triangle is 24 meters, find the perimeter of the larger triangle, assuming the similarity factor is 2.**
   - **Solution**: The perimeter of similar shapes scales with the same factor as their sides. If the similarity factor is 2, then the perimeter of the larger triangle is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) meters. This problem illustrates how the perimeters of similar shapes relate to each other.

10. **A cylindrical tower has a height of 10 meters and a diameter of 4 meters. A scale model of the tower is created at a scale of 1:5. Find the volume of the model.**
    - **Solution**: First, calculate the dimensions of the model: height \(= 10 \div 5 = 2\) meters, and diameter \(= 4 \div 5 = 0.8\) meters, giving a radius of 0.4 meters. Volume of a cylinder is \(\pi r^2 h\), so the model's volume is \(\pi \times 0.4^2 \times 2 \approx 1.005\) cubic meters.

11. **An isosceles right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse of 10√2 meters. Calculate the area of this triangle.**
    - **Solution**: In an isosceles right-angled triangle, the legs are equal. Using the Pythagorean theorem, each leg is \(10\) meters (because \(leg = \frac{hypotenuse}{\sqrt{2}}\)). Area = \(0.5 \times leg \times leg = 0.5 \times 10 \times 10 = 50\) square meters.

12. **A triangular plot of land is to be divided into two smaller plots of equal area by a line parallel to one of its sides. If the original plot has a base of 120 meters and a height of 80 meters, find the length of the dividing line.**
    - **Solution**: The area of the original triangle is \(0.5 \times base \times height = 0.5 \times 120 \times 80 = 4800\) square meters. Dividing the triangle into two equal areas results in each smaller triangle having an area of 2400 square meters. Since the line dividing the triangle is parallel to the base and divides the area in half, the height of each smaller triangle is 40 meters (half of the original height). The base of the smaller triangle (dividing line) remains 120 meters because the line is parallel to the base and does not alter the base's length.
