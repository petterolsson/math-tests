### Detailed Answers

#### 1. Square Painting with Uniform Border

- **Given**: 
  - Total area (painting + frame) = 400 cm²
  - Area of painting alone = 256 cm²
- **Find**: Width of the border

- **Solution**: 
  - Let the width of the border be \(x\) cm.
  - The side length of the painting is \(\sqrt{256} = 16\) cm.
  - The total length and width of the painting plus the frame are \(16 + 2x\) cm each.
  - So, the equation for the total area is \((16 + 2x)^2 = 400\).
  - Simplifying, \(16 + 2x = 20\) (since \(\sqrt{400} = 20\)).
  - Solving for \(x\), we get \(2x = 4\), thus \(x = 2\) cm.

#### 2. Square Fountain in Circular Park

- **Given**:
  - Park diameter = 100 meters, so park radius = 50 meters.
  - Fountain area is 1/625 of park's area.
- **Find**: Side length of the fountain.

- **Solution**:
  - Park area \(= \pi \times 50^2 \approx 7854\) square meters.
  - Fountain area \(= \frac{7854}{625} \approx 12.5664\) square meters.
  - Side length of the fountain \(= \sqrt{12.5664} \approx 3.5449\) meters.

#### 3. Staircase Horizontal Distance

- **Given**:
  - Height = 10 meters, Staircase length = 26 meters.
- **Find**: Horizontal distance.

- **Solution**:
  - Using Pythagoras, \(Horizontal^2 + 10^2 = 26^2\).
  - Solving for the horizontal distance, \(Horizontal = \sqrt{26^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{676 - 100} = \sqrt{576} = 24\) meters.

#### 4. High-wire Between Two Towers

- **Given**:
  - Distance between towers = 40 meters.
  - Heights = 30m and 60m.
- **Find**: Length of the wire.

- **Solution**:
  - Difference in height = 30 meters.
  - Using Pythagoras, \(Wire^2 = 40^2 + 30^2 = 2500\).
  - Wire length \(= \sqrt{2500} = 50\) meters.

#### 5. Diagonal Path Through Rectangular Plot

- **Given**:
  - Dimensions = 50m x 40m.
- **Find**: Length of diagonal path and difference in area if split.

- **Solution**:
  - Diagonal \(= \sqrt{50^2 + 40^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 1600} = \sqrt{4100} = 64.031\) meters.
  - The area of the whole plot \(= 2000\) square meters. Splitting doesn't change the total area, so each triangle's area is 1000 square meters. The difference is in the shape, not the area.

#### 6. Irrigation Canal Around a Field

- **Given**:
  - Field dimensions = 150m x 100m, Canal width = 5m.
- **Find**: Total area covered by the canal.

- **Solution**:
  - The outer dimensions of the canal = \(160m \times 110m\) (adding twice the width to each dimension).
  - Total area of the field with the canal \(= 160 \times 110 = 17600\) square meters.
  - Area of just the field \(= 150 \times 100 = 15000\) square meters.
  - Area covered by the canal \(= 17600 - 15000 = 2600\) square meters.

#### 7. Circular Pool with Walkway

- **Given**:
  - Pool diameter = 14 meters, Total area = 254 square meters.
- **Find**: Width of the walkway.

- **Solution**:
  - Pool radius = 7 meters, so pool area \(= \pi \times 7^2 \approx 153.94\) square meters.
  - Area of the walkway \(= 254 - 153.94 = 100.06\) square meters.
  - Let the outer radius (pool + walkway) be \(r\). Total area \(= \pi r^2 = 254\).
  - Solving for \(r

\), we find \(r \approx 9\) meters.
  - Width of the walkway \(= 9 - 7 = 2\) meters.

#### 8. Fencing a Rectangular Area with Barn

- **Given**:
  - Barn length = 20 meters, Total area = 800 square meters.
- **Find**: Minimum length of the fence.

- **Solution**:
  - Width of the fenced area \(= \frac{800}{20} = 40\) meters.
  - Fence needed for the two widths and one length \(= 40 + 40 + 20 = 100\) meters.

#### 9. Broken Pole

- **Given**:
  - Top touches the ground 3 meters from the base, original height = 5 meters.
- **Find**: Height where it broke.

- **Solution**:
  - Let the height where it broke be \(h\).
  - Using Pythagoras, \(h^2 + 3^2 = 5^2\).
  - Solving for \(h\), \(h = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4\) meters.

#### 10. Sprinkler in Triangular Flower Bed

- **Given**:
  - Sides = 4m and 3m.
- **Find**: Area the sprinkler can water.

- **Solution**:
  - Hypotenuse \(= \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5\) meters.
  - Area of the flower bed \(= \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6\) square meters.
  - Sprinkler covers a circular area with radius = 5 meters, so \(Area = \pi \times 5^2 = 25\pi \approx 78.54\) square meters.
  - Additional area watered \(= 78.54 - 6 = 72.54\) square meters.
